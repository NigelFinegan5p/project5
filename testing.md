## Code Validation

### HTML Validation

For my HTML files, I have used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

Since the project uses Jinja syntax (like {% extends "base.html" %} and {{ form|crispy }}) and requires user authentication, this method was used for validation:

1. Navigate to each individual page via the deployed Heroku app link.
2. Right-click the screen or use `CTRL+U` (`‚åò+U` on Mac) to "View page source."
3. Copy the complete HTML code and paste it into the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) option.
4. Fix any errors or warnings, revalidate, and record results.

All pages passed validation. One error was shown, and I reached out to Tutor support regarding it.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate my JS files. The JS files in my project were not written by me but were taken from Boutique Ado, Stripe, and course material from Django by Antonio Miele.

All files passed with no errors.  The Stripe JS did not come from me so I am leaving it deployed.

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

All files passed with no errors, additionally the VS code and installed app has allowed each file to highlight errors (problems) and omissions in the CLI Command line interface.

Running the following commmand ( python -m flake8 --exclude .venv,.vscode,migrations )
This command shows any additional linting issues and unused code functions.

| Edge    | Works as intended                                                    |
| Safari  | Works as intended                                                    |
| Firefox | Works as intended                                                    |
| Opera   | Works as intended                                                    |
| Brave   | Works as intended                                                    |


<br>

All validation tools and device/browser testing confirm that the project functions as intended across platforms, with only minor tweaks needed for enhanced responsiveness and visual polish

## Lighthouse Audit

I tested my project using the Lighthouse tool in Chrome DevTools on each page to ensure it performs well across various aspects.

At first, I used the Lighthouse extension, which gave me higher performance scores. However, when I switched to using the Lighthouse tool in Chrome DevTools, the scores were lower than expected. To make sure I had accurate results, I retried the tests for all pages using DevTools, and the scores below are based on those updated tests.

While the performance scores are not as high as I would like them to be, I plan to work on improving them in future updates. My main concern was the accessibility scores, and I‚Äôm happy to report that they look great, which is a positive outcome.

# üçñ Coders Roast House ‚Äì Bug Fix Hold-Off üêû

At Coders Roast House, we spotted that pesky bug where the minus (‚Äì) button in the shopping bag doesn‚Äôt disable when the quantity hits 1 ‚Äî especially on desktop.

Code Institute offers a fix for this, and while it technically works, we found it added way too much lag to the ‚ÄúAdd to Bag‚Äù process.

And let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî no one wants a slow checkout when they‚Äôre hungry for clean code.

**So we skipped the fix** in the walkthrough version to keep the experience fast and smooth.

If you‚Äôre after full functionality and don‚Äôt mind the extra weight, you can still find the fix in the final code.

# üîÆ Future Features Coming Soon to Coders Roast House

### 1. **Faster Checkout Experience**  
We know your time is valuable (especially when there‚Äôs coffee to be had). Our new turbocharged checkout system will get your order through faster than your Wi-Fi speed test can process. No lag, no delays ‚Äî just smooth, seamless purchasing. 

### 2. **Dynamic Product Recommendations**  
Ever wish your shopping experience could read your mind? Well, we‚Äôre getting pretty close. With personalized product recommendations based on what you‚Äôve browsed and purchased, we‚Äôre making sure you never run out of coffee ‚Äî or cool new finds. It's like having your own coffee concierge.  

### 3. **Dark Mode for Night Owls**  
For those late-night coding sprints or 2 a.m. coffee cravings, we‚Äôre introducing Dark Mode. Because who needs a blinding screen when you‚Äôre trying to caffeinate in peace? It's sleek, stylish, and easy on the eyes ‚Äî so you can keep sipping without squinting.

### 4. **User Account Features**  
Your coffee experience just got even more personal. With new user accounts, you‚Äôll be able to save your favorite products, track your order history, and access special discounts. It‚Äôs like your own digital coffee vault ‚Äî only with less danger of running out of beans.

### 6. **The Sophine Story**  
Meet Sophine ‚Äî our best customer, and also the inspiration behind our signature roast. As a designer who‚Äôs always on the lookout for perfect details, Sophine's journey with Coders Roast House started on a quest for exceptional, ethically-sourced coffee. From the moment she took her first sip, she fell in love with the rich, bold flavor of our beans.  

We‚Äôre sharing her journey with you ‚Äî from the small hillside farm where it all begins, to the careful roasting process, and ultimately to the cup in Sophine's hands. It‚Äôs a story of craftsmanship, passion, and a designer's eye for perfection. And much like her design work, Sophine's relationship with our coffee is all about the perfect balance of heritage, heart, and just the right amount of drama.

### The Evolution of Project Swan: A Journey Through QA, Project Management, and Scope

You've officially reached the conclusion of **Project Swan** ‚Äî an ambitious journey that started as a small idea and grew into something much larger than we initially imagined. **Congratulations!** Take a moment to appreciate how far you've come. And yes, go ahead, enjoy that well-deserved coffee ‚Äî you've earned it.

**Project Swan** began as part of the **Code Institute‚Äôs HTML/CSS coffee house walkthrough**, a simple static site designed to introduce key web development concepts. But what started as a mockup of a coffee shop website quickly evolved into a full-stack eCommerce platform. As the vision expanded, so did the **scope**. The basic caf√© site transformed into an online store with a fully functional shopping cart, checkout flow, and Stripe integration ‚Äî a far cry from the humble beginnings.

We kicked things off on **December 28th, 2024**, still recovering from the holiday rush, fueled by leftover snacks, and no doubt, a little too much caffeine. The early stages were filled with excitement and optimism. However, as we progressed, we learned that managing the **scope**, keeping an eye on **timelines**, and staying disciplined with **project management** would be key to delivering a successful product.

### The Project Management Realities: Scope, Scale, and Timelines

- **Managing Scope:** Early on, we had to balance **ambition** with **realism**. What started as a small, static caf√© site quickly grew into a full-stack application. As features piled up, so did the complexity. It became clear that we had to be strategic about how much we could actually deliver, especially when time was limited. We continuously checked back with the initial goals, ensuring the scope didn‚Äôt expand beyond what was feasible within the given timeline.

- **Scale and Complexity:** As features like the shopping cart, Stripe integration, and dynamic user accounts were introduced, the scale of the project increased. Suddenly, we were working with **backend** and **frontend** complexities that were much more involved than anticipated. At this point, effective **project management** was crucial. We had to prioritize tasks, break down each feature into manageable chunks, and track progress carefully to avoid scope creep.

- **Timelines:** We learned the hard way that no project is immune to **timeline challenges**. Initially, we underestimated how long some of the features ‚Äî particularly the payment gateway integration ‚Äî would take. This put significant pressure on me and tested my **time management** skills to the maximum. Deadlines loomed, and it was clear that i needed a more disciplined approach to keep things on track. I was constantly re-evaluating timelines, but through careful adjustments and iterative planning, finally we were able to meet most of our goals.

### What We Learned: Key QA Insights

- **Debugging is a craft, not a checklist:** As our first eCommerce project evolved from a simple static site to a fully integrated platform, debugging became a nuanced process. It wasn‚Äôt just about fixing issues but about proactively identifying and addressing potential problems early on. **Manual click-by-click testing** played a key role, allowing us to uncover hidden issues, especially when testing complex flows like the shopping cart and payment processing via **Stripe**. We also used **webhooks for Stripe** to validate payment transactions and ensure proper order updates.

- **Running tests 3x in the CLI:** Introducing features like the shopping cart and **Stripe integration** led to flaky tests and occasional inconsistencies. To ensure accuracy, we ran tests multiple times through the **CLI** using **Python**, **Stripe CLI**, and **PowerShell**. Running tests **3x in the terminal** helped us replicate real-world user conditions and provided a better understanding of how the platform performed in various scenarios. This approach allowed us to detect and resolve issues more efficiently.

- **Flaky tests: The unpredictable elements:** With new features came challenges like flaky tests, particularly in integration points such as **Stripe** payments. These inconsistencies made us question the reliability of our testing strategy. However, instead of getting frustrated, we tackled each flaky test with persistence. Running tests through the CLI and manually reproducing the issues helped us refine our approach and improve the stability of the platform.

Despite the challenges, we emerged with valuable insights and a project that is now functional, feature-rich, and much more reliable. Yes, a few bugs remain, but they are part of the learning journey and will continue to shape our development process.

### Key Takeaways from **Project Swan**:

- **Testing is non-negotiable:** As the project grew, we learned that testing must always align with the evolving scope of the project. Early testing helped us avoid last-minute panic fixes. **Project Swan** showed us that testing is more than just a box to check ‚Äî it‚Äôs essential to prevent scope creep from affecting the end product.

- **Planning and discipline are paramount:** One of the hardest lessons we learned was that discipline in project management ensures success. As the scope grew, so did the temptation to cut corners. However, sticking to a plan, managing timelines effectively, and consistently testing allowed us to meet deadlines without compromising the quality of the final product.

- **Assertive testing ensures quality:** With new features like the shopping cart and Stripe integration, testing became even more critical. **Assertive testing** ‚Äî testing what matters most to the user ‚Äî allowed us to avoid unexpected failures. The lesson: If a feature is essential, it needs to be tested **rigorously** and **early**.

**Project Swan** has been a tremendous learning experience. We‚Äôve gained a deeper understanding of **scope management**, **timelines**, and the need for careful **project planning** to maintain quality as a project grows in scale. In the end, success wasn‚Äôt about luck ‚Äî it was about staying focused, being adaptable, and always improving.
