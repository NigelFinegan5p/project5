## Code Validation

### HTML Validation

For my HTML files, I have used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

Since the project uses Jinja syntax (like {% extends "base.html" %} and {{ form|crispy }}) and requires user authentication, this method was used for validation:

1. Navigate to each individual page via the deployed Heroku app link.
2. Right-click the screen or use `CTRL+U` (`‚åò+U` on Mac) to "View page source."
3. Copy the complete HTML code and paste it into the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) option.
4. Fix any errors or warnings, revalidate, and record results.

All pages passed validation. One error was shown, and I reached out to Tutor support regarding it.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

All files passed with no errors.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate my JS files. The JS files in my project were not written by me but were taken from Boutique Ado, Stripe, and course material from Django by Antonio Miele.

All files passed with no errors.  The Stripe JS did not come from me so I am leaving it deployed.

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

All files passed with no errors, additionally the VS code and installed app has allowed each file to highlight errors (problems) and omissions in the CLI Command line interface.

Running the following commmand ( python -m flake8 --exclude .venv,.vscode,migrations )
This command shows any additional linting issues and unused code functions.

## Dev Tools/Real World Device Testing
---

Responsiveness testing was carried out using Google Dev Tools on the devices detailed within the below table. Responsiveness was evident on all features throughout all tested devices. ( 320 x 640 tested extensively )
  
<br>
<br>

### Dev Tools Device Testing - all features tested, issues noted below

| Device             | Feature                              | Issue                | Fix                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| iPhone             | Product detail page                  | Page works well, adequate space | None needed                                                         |
| Responsive 320 x 640 | All features                        | No issues            | None needed                                                         |
| iPad Mini          | Product page and product detail page | Satisfactory layout  | Updated Bootstrap for responsiveness                                |
| Galaxy Z Fold 5    | Product page and product detail page | Satisfactory layout  | Updated CSS and Bootstrap for responsiveness and button color consistency |

   
<br>
<br>

### Real World Device Testing

| Device             | Feature       | Issue      | Fix         |
|--------------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Samsung S8         | All features  | No issues  | None needed |
| iPad Pro+ (2019)   | All features  | No issues  | None needed |
| HP ProBook         | All features  | No issues  | None needed |
| Google Android     | All features  | No issues  | None needed |
| Samsung S Series   | All features  | No issues  | None needed |

<br>
<br>

### Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Notes                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome  | Works as expected and intended (majority market share browser)       |
| Edge    | Works as intended                                                    |
| Safari  | Works as intended                                                    |
| Firefox | Works as intended                                                    |
| Opera   | Works as intended                                                    |
| Brave   | Works as intended                                                    |


<br>

All validation tools and device/browser testing confirm that the project functions as intended across platforms, with only minor tweaks needed for enhanced responsiveness and visual polish

## Lighthouse Audit

I tested my project using the Lighthouse tool in Chrome DevTools on each page to ensure it performs well across various aspects.

At first, I used the Lighthouse extension, which gave me higher performance scores. However, when I switched to using the Lighthouse tool in Chrome DevTools, the scores were lower than expected. To make sure I had accurate results, I retried the tests for all pages using DevTools, and the scores below are based on those updated tests.

While the performance scores are not as high as I would like them to be, I plan to work on improving them in future updates. My main concern was the accessibility scores, and I‚Äôm happy to report that they look great, which is a positive outcome.

| **3. Validate Webhook Trigger** | Confirm that Stripe sends webhook events: `payment_intent.created`, `charge.succeeded`, `payment_intent.succeeded`, and `charge.updated`. | Webhooks are received with 200 responses and correctly logged. | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **4. Verify Order in Database** | Check that a new order is recorded in the database. | Order matches the Stripe transaction ID and details. | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **5. Test Payment Failure** | Use a failing card (e.g., `4000 0000 0000 9995` - insufficient funds). | Payment fails with appropriate error message. | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **6. Check Email Notifications** | Confirm that a confirmation email is sent after successful payment. | Email is received with accurate order details. | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **7. Test 3D Secure (Auth Required)** | Use a card that requires authentication (e.g., `4000 0025 0000 3155`). | 3D Secure authentication modal appears. | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **8. Confirm Auth Success** | Complete the authentication in the test modal. | Payment succeeds, user is redirected, and webhook triggers. | ‚úÖ Pass |

# üçñ Coders Roast House ‚Äì Bug Fix Hold-Off üêû

At Coders Roast House, we spotted that pesky bug where the minus (‚Äì) button in the shopping bag doesn‚Äôt disable when the quantity hits 1 ‚Äî especially on desktop.

Code Institute offers a fix for this, and while it technically works, we found it added way too much lag to the ‚ÄúAdd to Bag‚Äù process.

And let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî no one wants a slow checkout when they‚Äôre hungry for clean code.

**So we skipped the fix** in the walkthrough version to keep the experience fast and smooth.

If you‚Äôre after full functionality and don‚Äôt mind the extra weight, you can still find the fix in the final code.
